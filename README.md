# Creating a Load Balancer in Rust

This is a Load Balancer implemented in Rust for learning purposes. A load balancer routes client requests across multiple servers, ensuring efficient distribution, high availability, and flexibility to adapt to server changes.

## About Load Balancers

A load balancer is a crucial component in managing network traffic efficiently. It performs several functions:

- Distributes client requests/network load efficiently across multiple servers.
- Ensures high availability and reliability by sending requests only to online servers.
- Provides the flexibility to add or subtract servers as demand dictates.

### Key Functions

- Balancing incoming client requests among backend servers.
- Health checks to ensure server availability.
- Handling server failures and re-routing traffic when servers go offline.
- Re-activating servers when they come back online.

## Acknowledgments

This project was inspired by the concept of load balancing in network systems. It's a learning project that explores the fundamentals of creating a load balancer from scratch.
